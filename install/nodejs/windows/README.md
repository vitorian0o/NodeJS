# Installation Node.js - Windows

1. Download Node.JS from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org);
   - There are two versions available:
     - **LTS**: Recommended for most users, focused on stability.
     - **Current**: Includes the latest features but may have experimental updates.

## What is LTS and Current?

- **LTS** stands for *Long Term Support*. These versions are designed for stability and are maintained with critical security and bug fixes for an extended period (typically 30 months). LTS is ideal for production environments and users who prioritize reliability.
- **Current** is the latest version of Node.js with cutting-edge features. It is updated frequently and may include experimental updates. This version is best suited for developers looking to explore new features or build projects that do not require long-term stability.
