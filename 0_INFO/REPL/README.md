## What is REPL?

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It is an interactive programming environment that allows users to write code and immediately see the results. REPL is commonly used in various programming languages, including JavaScript, and is a useful tool for quickly testing and learning the syntax and behavior of a language.

### How does REPL work?

1. **Read:** The REPL reads the user's input (usually a line of code or an expression).
2. **Eval:** The code is evaluated or executed.
3. **Print:** The result of the evaluation is printed to the screen.
4. **Loop:** The process repeats, allowing the user to test different expressions or code at any time.

### What is REPL used for?

- **Testing Code:** REPL allows you to quickly test small snippets of code without needing to create a file or a full development environment.
- **Learning:** For beginners, REPL is an excellent tool for experimenting with and understanding how a language works.
- **Prototyping:** You can use REPL for quick prototyping of ideas or experiments without writing a full code file.
- **Debugging:** In some cases, REPL can be used to test parts of the code during the debugging process, making it easier to identify issues.

### How to use REPL in Node.js?

1. **Open the terminal** or command prompt.
2. **Type `node`** and press Enter to start the Node.js REPL. You will see an interactive prompt where you can type JavaScript code.
3. **Type your code** and see the result immediately.

Example:
```bash
$ node
> console.log("Hello, World!");
Hello, World!
>
```

### Important Note

The data and code executed in the REPL environment are temporary. Once you close the terminal or restart the REPL, all previous code and results will be lost. Therefore, it is recommended to use REPL for testing small snippets of code or for learning purposes. For more persistent code and results, it's better to use a text editor or IDE to write your code in files.
